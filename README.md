# intrusion-detection-by-deep-learning
In this study, a novel method for intrusion detection is developed using deep neural networks. 
The NSL-KDD dataset is being considered in this study where data is first cleaned, processed, and prepared for training in a deep learning network. DNN network with three hidden layers is used to classify the features stored in the data store to classify around 2 classes I.e normal and intrusion detected. The model gave an accuracy of 94% for given hyperparameters and the DNN model. This model is also tested on unseen data to check the prediction accuracy of the model and when compared with the actual labels datastore it gave similar accuracy so there is no overfitting and underfitting model. Except for accuracy, the score e model is also evaluated over other performance metrics I.e F1 score, recall, and precision, and these values are also really satisfactory.
